zip has moved
=============

This repository was formerly the source of the [zip](https://crates.io/crates/zip) Rust crate for compressing and decompressing ZIP files, but that has moved to https://github.com/Pr0methean/zip. Please submit all issues and pull requests there, and close any existing copies here. Once the existing ones are closed, this repository will be archived.
